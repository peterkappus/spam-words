# spam-words
A postmodern jukebox: random pairings of words designed to deceive spam filters coupled with random chords which create a mysterious and sometimes unsettling narrative in the mind of the viewer.

## Artist's Statement

Around 2004, I began noticing pseudo-random words appearing at the foot of spam emails that I received. I realised these were actually carefully selected to deceive spam-filters into allowing these messages through. Over several years I collected a few thousand of these words and phrases.

I found this a really interesting statement on how advertising can infect and subvert normal human communication and semantics with a kind of pseudo-random, aggressive, and vaguely malignant "noise".

Designed for large-scale indoor projection, the piece randomly combines two of these words at a time with four random musical tones to create a chord which may be harmonious or discordant. The effect is a highly charged, infinitely changing emotional space in which the viewer's mind struggles to construct meaning and significance in a completely randomised condition. Much like our entire experience of life.
